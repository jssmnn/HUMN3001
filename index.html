            <p> The first Australian’s have been baking for over 60 000 years, </p>
            <p> They would grind down grain with stones until a flour appeared, </p>
            <p> Then mix in some water, bake it in coals — a whole mob it would feed, </p>
            <p> They cultivated plants and seed, tending to the land's needs. </p>
